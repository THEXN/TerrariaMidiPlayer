# TerrariaMidiPlayer ![AppIcon](http://i.imgur.com/a6EWzOg.png)
A midi player for Terrarian instruments. Please note that Terraria Midi Player takes control of your mouse while playing a midi.

### Notes
* None of the menu options work yet.
* Click on the projectile angle and drag for easy aiming.
* Use the mouse wheel while dragging to change the range.

### Settings
* Use Time (in frames): The use time of the instrument. Setting it to 3 is recommended assuming you've overridden it ingame.
* Click Time (in milliseconds): How long the mouse is held down to simulate an instrument noise. The longer times are more likely to work while shorter times fail occasionally. 40 should be enough.
* Checks: How often Terraria Midi Player makes checks that you're still inside Terraria when playing a song. This helps reduce accidentally clicking somewhere inconvenient.

### Keybinds (At the moment)
These keybinds function even when the program does not have focus.
* Force Close: Escape
* Play/Continue Midi: Numpad 0
* Pause Midi: Numpad 1
* Stop Midi: Numpad 2
